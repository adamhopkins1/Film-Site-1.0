        <h2 id="sec0">Thoughts on the Fall lineup of Films</h2>

        <p>Fall is here a time of new seasons and weather and a new season of films currently as of this writing we are
          in time for the NYFF (New York Film Festival) after the Venice Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival we
          now arrive in the Second-Third batch of compettions prior to BFI(London Film Festival) and then deliberations
          and nominations for the tail end festival alongside the end year awards nominations. If it feels like this has
          been short that's because it has felt like this in 1 year since the COVID-19 pandemic it has been mostly
          virtual events due to the social distancing measures taken by the film festivals.In this current crop of films
          I was surprised about many levels of things Netflix has been releasing films that have not lived up to
          expectations and has recieved muted reviews or backlas as in the case of Noah Baumbachs's white noise,
          Alejandro G. Innaritu's BARDO or Andrew Dominik's polarizing Blonde.</p>

        <hr class="col-md-12">
        In other ways the studios are also having setbacks we've seen films like Empire of Light from Sam Mendes which
        has recieved mixed reviews but there is Universal Studios The Fabelmans which alongside MGM's Woman Talking from
        Sarah Polley, have been considered as frontrunners for best picture. But besides the films that are condidered
        front runners we have now films from A24
        s The Whale and Focus Features TAR starring Brendan Fraiser and Cate Blanchette respectively in the general
        conversation for Best Actor and Actress overall this has been interesting as we are nearing the middle-mark of
        the film season we have yet to have viewings and (I have seen only Athena and Blonde on Netflix.) I am set to
        see TAR on October 21st of this month, alongside The Banshees of Inirsheer and TILL from Fox searchlight and
        MGM/Orion Pictures resepctively. The Film Season wont be decided until end of year 2022 after that we have
        Golden Globe and then Academy Nominations also the start of the Sundance Film Festival and Berlin Film
        Festival.So what are my thoughts: Its very early in terms of viewing films and general consensus on the current
        crop of films. But being very personal it was shocking to see films such as Empire of Light which should've been
        a excellent release from Fox Searchlight, ended up dissapointing at the festivals.Florian Zeller's The Son
        Surprisingly was not well recieved by Venice or Telluride. So the films that everyone thought would be a home
        run evetually did not play well. It was extremely surprising to see people not recieve films as originally
        anticipated.

        <h2 id="sec1">Interview with Sarah Polley About Women Talking.</h2>
        <p>
          Sarah Polley, Frances McDormand, Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, and the rest of the film's team gather in Telluride
          to talk their radical collaboration.

                <h3>Vanity Fair Interview with Sarah Polley and Cast from Telluride.</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">or the past few days, I’ve seen the Women Talking team everywhere: Mingling at a
                welcome brunch deep in the mountains, rushing down Colorado Avenue on the way to their next thing,
                taking their seats for the Empire of Light premiere. They travel in a pack, often with big smiles and
                bigger laughs. And why wouldn’t they? Sarah Polley’s powerful new film, swiftly met with raves after its
                premiere here in Telluride, has been the talk of the festival, and represents creative highs for
                everyone from its Oscar-nominated writer-director to its peerless ensemble. None of them, even legendary
                producer-star Frances McDormand, have had an experience like this before. The film is fully made by and
                centered on women, and has been unveiled to the world with the team behind it united as a collective, a
                group of artists rightly proud of what they’ve done..
                Adapted from the Miriam Toews novel, Women Talking is set in a remote, present-day Mennonite colony
                operating under an archaic patriarchal system. The story’s catalyst arrives as young Autje (Kate
                Hallett) catches one man brutally attacking a woman; the women of the colony are finally awoken to the
                violence and cruelty they’ve been subjected to throughout their lives, that they’d been led to believe
                were random acts of God. And so now, they must gather and talk about it, in an isolated hayloft—to
                decide whether to stand their ground and fight the men who’ve so wronged them, or leave together toward
                the great unknown. Out of this setup, which Polley renders with rich and surprising cinematic intensity,
                characters prove distinctive in their beliefs, faith, and dreams—from Jessie Buckley’s cynical Mariche
                to Claire Foy’s ferocious Salome to Rooney Mara’s measured Ona. A cathartic conversation emerges, about
                asserting one’s personhood (specifically, womanhood) while working methodically toward rousing
                collective action, with hope for a better tomorrow.<a

                <h3>The women of ‘Women Talking’ react to taking festival season by storm</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">Frances McDormand, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley and other actors in the ensemble of
                Sarah Polley’s extraordinary drama “Women Talking” were walking into the Werner Herzog Theatre for a
                post-screening Q&A Sunday just as a few members of the audience were leaving the venue. A friend of
                Buckley’s spied the actor near the entrance and embraced her, sobbing. They clung to each other for
                nearly a minute.
                “Never had that happen before, nope,” Buckley said later, still feeling the moment deeply.

                It’s likely to occur again, given the film’s thoughtful, moving examination of faith and forgiveness, of
                women coming to terms with trauma and debating how to move past it — if that’s even possible. Adapted
                from Miriam Toews’ 2018 novel, “Women Talking” centers on the women in an isolated, fictional Mennonite
                sect who have been drugged and sexually assaulted. The women and girls must decide whether to stay and
                forgive the men — the only way, they’re told, that they can enter the kingdom of heaven — or stand and
                fight the men. Or pack up and leave the only home they’ve ever known.

                Polley, who adapted and directed the film, describes the story as “bewilderingly hopeful,” which sounds
                like a bit of salesmanship — except it’s true. (“I’ve shown it to some teenagers,” producer Dede Gardner
                says by phone, “and they literally vibrate. It seems it’s almost anthemic to them.”) The conversations
                these women have in a hayloft — they must make a decision in 48 hours before the men are bailed out of
                jail — are thrilling in their clear, empathetic and nuanced understanding of the validity of differing
                viewpoints and, ultimately, the power of community.<a

        <h2 id="sec2">Scenes from Toronto Film Festival:The Fabelmans Premier</h2>
        <p>
          Steven Spielberg’s new film The Fabelmans has won the Toronto international film festival’s People’s Choice
          award, long regarded in the film industry as a key indicator of awards success over the next few months.

          The Fabelmans, directed by Spielberg and co-written with Angels in America playwright Tony Kushner, has been
          hailed as Spielberg’s most autobiographical film and has won generally admiring reviews. The story of a
          teenage boy coping with his parents’ disintegrating marriage in the 60s midwest, the Guardian described it as
          a “rare insight into the world’s most famous director who has usually kept us at arm’s length”.

        <h2 id="sec4">TIFF: Steven Spielberg Says Pandemic Made Him Realize ‘The Fabelmans’ Was a Film He Had to “Get
          Out of Me Now”</h2>
        The morning after Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans had its world premiere in Toronto — a screening that
        immediately catapulted the film into pundits‘ top movie lists going into awards season — the director and his
        cast sat down to talk about the movie with festival CEO Cameron Bailey.

        Telling the story of Spielberg’s early life in post-WWII Arizona and his earliest flashes of filmmaking insight
        alongside family trauma, the film is by far the director’s most personal to date, and stars Gabriel LaBelle as
        Sammy Fabelman, based on Spielberg, together with Paul Dano, Michelle Williams, Seth Rogan and Judd Hirsch.<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/steven-spielberg-the-fabelmans-interview-1235217241/">Read More...</a>
