                            <p>At this point in the oscar chances The Fabelmans is the current frontrunner It has won the Audience Awards at the TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) and is set to premier at the NYFF (New York Film Festival) there are stil films that are in the runnning even though its been a somewhat dissapointing year in premiers we've seen Empire of Light recive overall terrible audience/critics scores, and other Films that have premiered at the Venice Film festival from netflix have not been well recieved spelling trouble for the streamer. However its been only 2 months in there are still films that are yet to release this year personally I have not seen anything that premiered at the film festival the first wave will be in October for Todd Fields TAR.As one might say the best is yet to come....</p>

                            <p>Hollywood is a kill it or be killed business you can have a acclaimed film one day only to fall into the trappings of making films worthy of your title as writer/director in the film world this atlas sized task is mainly focused on Women and Minority/POC Filmakers it can be one strike and youre out. Thus we come to this internal/external impasse keep making films on the treadmill or to use a football term throw a Hail Mary pass that will hopefully buy you more time before becoming devoured by the audience and critics who are more hungry for meat thats not red.Lets take Olivia Wilde she started as an actress linked herself to top movie stars and worked her way through the hollywood grinder and she's just started becoming a writer/director recently with her film <i>Booksmart</i> a comedy in the vein of Superbad and her newest movie <i>Dont Worry Darling</i> which was mired in controversy due to hollywood gossipers/tabloids looking to spread drama about the films creation and cast "troubles" many of which is manufactured and not so much drama as just daily life for female filmakers who are almost ridiculed and derided for their work. The amazing thing about the critics and film pundits is that its manufactured to "destroy" a project thats doesnt meet the audience/film critics/tabloids expectations. Thus with a film like don't worry darling which as of saturday 9/24/2022 the movie has made over 20 million according to theatertracker a reliable source for tracking theater sales really capturing a strong reaction from female movie viewers who have come out in support of the film leads who are Florence Pugh, Harry Styles ( The current teen dream) and Chris Pine it has this feminist theme about male control over women and it recalls obviously "The Stepford Wives" it has tracked higher than Jordan Peele's debut film "Get Out" and has made more money than Last weekend's Viola Davis starrer "The Woman King" If the future is Female it is going to take an vision independent of male vision of what constitutes as female driven films. We are seeing this with female led auteur projects many of them that have released and many that has either been greenlit or in production. It will have to differentiate from the norm so to speak and yes have universality attacthed to their concepts and not be exclusionary to other audience demographics. If we can do that it will pay off for not only female writer/directors but it will defintely take off for studios as well we have to look at the previous winners of best director at the 2020 and 2021 Academy Awards which was Chloe Zhao for Nomadland and Jane Campion for The Power of the Dog these films were from the beginning meant to have strong female auteur level prescence and represenations. It has me questioning whether the idea of the Francois Trauffalt personage of the Autuer is really a construct of male gaze patriarchy or is it more or less a way of control that excludes the universal welcome tent of inclusionary filmaking.One can only find that the ideas presented only serves one aspect of gender over the wider demographics of filmakers irrecspective of gender,race, or nationality. We see this in the need for gender-neutral acting which I believe will be introducing inequality in the Acting guilds and categories for the films eligleble for the AMPAS and the Oscars in 2024 excluding or picking favorites based on the Academy members perrogative or preferences for Actors and Actresses though I have the feeling it will be an issue for Female Actresses where the female leads will have less chances at winning awards only to have them work twice as hard in their category to compete with male actors. This is going to cause either a wider gap for actors and actresses in terms of their perfomances and campaigning outside the film proper.It doesnt help that the Academy who's over 10,000 members have to decide to award the acting awards to a woman or man. It just creates a higher mandate that many actresses and actors will have to be pressured to perform to this brings not only undue stress but more or less makes the catorization polarizing and not a seperate respectable category and the main thing the outside observers of the Oscars always says is that its rigged just as a election or a race is rigged but that could be farther from the truth. Films have come far from the days of Studios controlling actors and actresses and forcing lifetime contracts to studios we are in fortunate times and because of this bouty of media esp in films we should be avoiding introducing inequality and disconnect in the filmaking industry. We should have to make it compettive but not at the expense of introducing pressure and stress upon those who roles are to bring out the best performance in the writer/directors films.Films have power and to divert or try to control that power only ends up in it backfiring on not only the actor/actresses film studios , productions but the audience and industry as a whole. </p>
