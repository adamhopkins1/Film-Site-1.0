                            <p>At this point in the oscar chances The Fabelmans is the current frontrunner It has won the Audience Awards at the TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) and is set to premier at the NYFF (New York Film Festival) there are stil films that are in the runnning even though its been a somewhat dissapointing year in premiers we've seen Empire of Light recive overall terrible audience/critics scores, and other Films that have premiered at the Venice Film festival from netflix have not been well recieved spelling trouble for the streamer. However its been only 2 months in there are still films that are yet to release this year personally I have not seen anything that premiered at the film festival the first wave will be in October for Todd Fields TAR.As one might say the best is yet to come But heres the kicker we are just 3 days from NYFF where the second wave of films will descend on the Lincoln Center in New York we have seen films such as "All the Beauty and the Bloodshed" "TAR" And "The Fabelmans" being showned to critics and alongside "The Banshees of Inisheer" and "The Whale" many of these films which will be in year end lists and conversations from Academy Members so in this I wanted to kind of explore what decisions and directions will be the main focus of the Academy going forward since we have seen the departure of AMPAS president Jeff Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson who have had to weather the storm  thorugh the preferential ballot to the first international film to win Best Picture in Parasite(2018) and through to this years cermony which alongside the first streamer in Apple Orignal Films winning for CODA(2021) it was the the infamous assaault on an presenter that hurt the academy beyond their ratings it was their reputations possibly scaring away filmakers and in-person participants from being a part of the ceremony. Now we have Bill Kruger as President of the Academy and Janet Yang heading as CEO of the AMPAS so what does this mean? In an interview I read recently it appears that they want to expand the academy's reach from just prestige films made in europe and the US to making it a truly international compettion where films from other countries can have the chance to expand and find an exposure to audiences. If films like "Parasite" or "Drive My Car" from Japan was able to make its way to Best Picture it seems that  BIll Kruger and Janet Yang may be on to something that 's a larger objective for the academy one that will have to give a platform for new visionary filmakers thats not in the western developed world or even in major eastern territories (As an aside Baltimore should thank Bill Kruger for recognizing local filmakers such as John Walters of "Flamingo" and "Hairspray"). The academy was also taking steps to make the international category much easier for entrants to be able to participate in. It helps in so many regards because when you take a step back and consider that films in the Best Picture territory have usually this requirement or benchmarks that have to be met and in the age of the preferential ballot where it open the door for different visions from many filmakers outside of the usual brood of film creators within the academy can  be able to have greater stronger recognition for their work. I also think that this elevates the storytelling and brings more innovation to the medium. For example Fox Searchlight first win for best picture was in 2008 when Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire" Won Best Picuture the film which was a CO-Production with film-4 and an Bollywood studio based in Mumbai showed that films that can be made in cooperation with other production studios in other countries or even helping those small independent studios in other countries to be able to have access and resources that the AMPAS can provide. I saw an vision of this earlier when I watched the trailer for "Aftersun" an upcoming film staring  Paul Mescal and directed by scottish indie filmaker Charlotte Wells from seeing the trailer I recognized that this is a much different perspective many people were referencing its dreamlike quality and meditatative structure. Its interesting to see films that have that much of an effect on the viewer in more ways than what an American-only perspective can provide. One can only wonder taht filmakers who are from differnt parts of the world can offer strong and different viewpoints in terms of how to embrace being a writer/director and really shows the power of the medium ultimately. I also can see these international filmakers from countries beyond europe such as India with the film "RRR" which has been a strong hit with viewers on Netflix one could surmise if these filmakers will be the next names to direct domestic films and give a stronger vision and perspective with their takes on  genres and characters.</p>

                            <p>Hollywood is a kill it or be killed business you can have a acclaimed film one day only to fall into the trappings of making films worthy of your title as writer/director in the film world this atlas sized task is mainly focused on Women and Minority/POC Filmakers it can be one strike and youre out. Thus we come to this internal/external impasse keep making films on the treadmill or to use a football term throw a Hail Mary pass that will hopefully buy you more time before becoming devoured by the audience and critics who are more hungry for meat thats not red.Lets take Olivia Wilde she started as an actress linked herself to top movie stars and worked her way through the hollywood grinder and she's just started becoming a writer/director recently with her film <i>Booksmart</i> a comedy in the vein of Superbad and her newest movie <i>Dont Worry Darling</i> which was mired in controversy due to hollywood gossipers/tabloids looking to spread drama about the films creation and cast "troubles" many of which is manufactured and not so much drama as just daily life for female filmakers who are almost ridiculed and derided for their work. The amazing thing about the critics and film pundits is that its manufactured to "destroy" a project thats doesnt meet the audience/film critics/tabloids expectations. Thus with a film like don't worry darling which as of saturday 9/24/2022 the movie has made over 20 million according to theatertracker a reliable source for tracking theater sales really capturing a strong reaction from female movie viewers who have come out in support of the film leads who are Florence Pugh, Harry Styles ( The current teen dream) and Chris Pine it has this feminist theme about male control over women and it recalls obviously "The Stepford Wives" it has tracked higher than Jordan Peele's debut film "Get Out" and has made more money than Last weekend's Viola Davis starrer "The Woman King" If the future is Female it is going to take an vision independent of male vision of what constitutes as female driven films. We are seeing this with female led auteur projects many of them that have released and many that has either been greenlit or in production. It will have to differentiate from the norm so to speak and yes have universality attacthed to their concepts and not be exclusionary to other audience demographics. If we can do that it will pay off for not only female writer/directors but it will defintely take off for studios as well we have to look at the previous winners of best director at the 2020 and 2021 Academy Awards which was Chloe Zhao for Nomadland and Jane Campion for The Power of the Dog these films were from the beginning meant to have strong female auteur level prescence and represenations. It has me questioning whether the idea of the Francois Trauffalt personage of the Autuer is really a construct of male gaze patriarchy or is it more or less a way of control that excludes the universal welcome tent of inclusionary filmaking.One can only find that the ideas presented only serves one aspect of gender over the wider demographics of filmakers irrecspective of gender,race, or nationality. We see this in the need for gender-neutral acting which I believe will be introducing inequality in the Acting guilds and categories for the films eligleble for the AMPAS and the Oscars in 2024 excluding or picking favorites based on the Academy members perrogative or preferences for Actors and Actresses though I have the feeling it will be an issue for Female Actresses where the female leads will have less chances at winning awards only to have them work twice as hard in their category to compete with male actors. This is going to cause either a wider gap for actors and actresses in terms of their perfomances and campaigning outside the film proper.It doesnt help that the Academy who's over 10,000 members have to decide to award the acting awards to a woman or man. It just creates a higher mandate that many actresses and actors will have to be pressured to perform to this brings not only undue stress but more or less makes the catorization polarizing and not a seperate respectable category and the main thing the outside observers of the Oscars always says is that its rigged just as a election or a race is rigged but that could be farther from the truth. Films have come far from the days of Studios controlling actors and actresses and forcing lifetime contracts to studios we are in fortunate times and because of this bouty of media esp in films we should be avoiding introducing inequality and disconnect in the filmaking industry. We should have to make it compettive but not at the expense of introducing pressure and stress upon those who roles are to bring out the best performance in the writer/directors films.Films have power and to divert or try to control that power only ends up in it backfiring on not only the actor/actresses film studios , productions but the audience and industry as a whole. </p>

                            <p>On a day in September came the premier of a long awaited film coming out of two back to back successes in Birdman and The Revenant and being compared to great filmakers such as John Ford and becoming on track to possibly succeed the directors of Old came BARDO:A False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths from the first press release saying that Netflix picked up the film for distribution here Alejandro G.Innaritu was at the Venice film festival sans Emmanuel Lubeszski sans the team at Le-grisbi and Sans Regency/Fox Searchlight for production resources instead it was Alfonso Cuaron's Production designer and a mexican production company called Chubusuro after rumors of security issues where a drunk person got into a fight with the security staff and the movie being made in the middle of COVID19 where everyone had to social distance and stay away from each other after spending 24+ hours expending and rewriting scripts and more script writing that last from morning to night after rewriting on set the scenes and ideas you had not put on the first,second and final draft after walking through scenes after scenes rehearsing them constantly and really wanting to make your 8 1/2 or 12 1/2 epic about yourself inspired by yourself you tire and filmed to your limits and suddenly here you are at the lido at Venice the place that gave you your first Golden Lion you've finally made your masterpiece and here you are Netflix gave you <i>Carte Blanche</i> to do whatever you wanted to do with your story they respect (fear) you for the fact that you've won back to back awards particularly in Best Directing. Surely you have finally reached the point where you've mastered film. Have you? Heart pulsating palms sweating you made your Diary for the world to now see and as you watch the film you look at others reaction the guy in front of you looks at the screen and makes snide comments about the scenes saying probably that thought this guy was good his this is shit. The other critic you can overhear in italian probably saying that the film is defintely not your best work. You can see in one of the aisles one of the viewers asleep and you feel the tension the sweat pulsing down you, your heart beating more times faster than usual youve realized that after you tried to create your 8 1/2 you've created less than that it doesnt match what your best perceived works are or exceeds what they want to see thus the film is critically panned and considered a project of self-indulgence and self-immolation than contributing to the bigger language of Cinema. When the lights went up after the credits rolled you started crying it felt like to you a personal weight was taken off your back but to critics it was going to be as the theater critic Tabitha Stevens in Birdman was going to be their mission to "Destroy your Play".And destroy they did places such as Hollywood Reporter, Variety Entertainment Weekly academy voters and members and blogs felt that the film didn't live or match expectations, welcome to a long line of dissapointments coming from venice films such as "The Son", to "Empire of Light" from esteemed and acclaimed filmakers such as Florian Zeller and Sam Mendes you have joined this unfortunate pantheon of filmakers for this current class of 2022.Thus the conversation being discussed is the offering of carte-blanche to directors for their passion projects. Earlier it was announced that Netflix will stop having passion projects or projects that are produced with the intention of being a directors only project based on the vision and ideas being presented in the film.Netflix was realizing that how much money they were losing money in that department and losing subscribers to lack of content. So not only is the streamer at a disadvantage the filmakers is also forced to find veteran producers to get their ideas out at other studios that are far more respected and have more experience than just streamers. Are these "Passion Projects" contributing to the lack of compelling content on the Netflix platform. This yields more study but in a nutshell we saw in early this year subscribers are creating a strategy of viewing a few films and then canceling their subscription to Netflix it caused a stronger dip in revenue for the streamer so putting this in perspective this is a bigger problem for streamers because in reality like the Rolling Stones song "You cant have what you want" There has to be limits to having successful but ambitious projects made we see another example of the streamer giving carte-blanche to filmakers in todays release "Blonde" directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Ana De Armas as Marilyn Monroe the film which earned a NC-17 rating from the streamer for its raw sexual content and tramatizing scenes could've helped by being pulled in from NC-17 to R rating. I've heard there is a scene in the film that is very traumtic to watch and it went as so far as to have the director questioned in a recent interview. I think this giving the director the plate without oversight is one of the causing factors of why carte-blanche projects can be a dangerous and very tricky endeavor for filmakers and creators it must be controlled or else we get insane instances such as what was described earlier. If Netflix is to prevent scenarios from getting out of control it will have to pull back and find viable projects with strong commerciability and strong strong appeal alongside storytelling that matches the other major studios projects and production. I find that this causes issues with trying to justify why streamers had put over 50-100+ Million into a project only to not get any major returns from it. We enter uncharted waters where in a year when Apple becomes the first streamer to win best picture at the Academy Awards.Streamers now that their an accepted form of enterntainment especially for Gen Z might have to act like the studios they were made to opposed only then and there can we find some semblance of operability responsibility over the filmakers material and vision. We should't have to return to the well constantly with giving directors complete and total control over a vision because there can be cases where the vision can be ultimately cross ethical/moral lines and blur the line between personal statements and what is art to the filmaker.If Netflix is to continue along this pattern it will cause problems for their creditbility as a part of the film industry. No one would want to see a day when Netflix is in the category as Pornography and Violence the film executives should understand that there needs to be control and guardrails need to be placed for the directors vision to succeed because if they allow to continually feed the director/ writers ego it results in projects that are bound to be dissapoinments, and that hurts film and cinema more than the need to give directors carte-blanche over their vision.</p>
